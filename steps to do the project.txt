🧩 Step 1: Setup AWS Account & Services
Create AWS Account (if you don’t have one)

Go to IAM → Create a role for Lambda execution:

✅ Allow permissions:

AmazonS3FullAccess

AmazonTextractFullAccess

AmazonTranscribeFullAccess

DynamoDBFullAccess

CloudWatchFullAccess

Textract

✅ Create an S3 bucket

For storing uploaded voice files and PDFs

✅ Create DynamoDB table

Table name: TelegramBotHistory

Partition key: chat_id (String)

Sort key: timestamp (Number)

🧩 Step 2: Setup the Telegram Bot
Go to BotFather on Telegram

Create a new bot, get your Telegram Token

Set the webhook:

Using AWS API Gateway → Lambda integration

🧩 Step 3: Write Lambda Function
✅ Write your Python code:

Handle incoming Telegram messages

Menu with options:

Generate Image (OpenAI API)

Q&A (HuggingFace API)

Voice Transcription (AWS Transcribe)

Sentiment Analysis (HuggingFace)

PDF Q&A (AWS Textract)

✅ Store chat history:

Log user message + bot response in DynamoDB

✅ Use environment variables:

TELEGRAM_TOKEN

HF_API_TOKEN

OPENAI_API_KEY

S3_BUCKET

AWS_REGION

✅ Return responses to the user directly in Telegram chat.

🧩 Step 4: Connect Lambda to Telegram
✅ Deploy Lambda function

✅ Setup API Gateway

Create REST API → Lambda integration

Deploy the API and get the invoke URL

✅ Set Webhook in Telegram:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<YOUR_API_GATEWAY_URL>
🧩 Step 5: Enable PDF Support (AWS Textract)
✅ When user uploads a PDF, store it in S3

✅ Trigger Textract to extract the text

✅ Use extracted text as context for answering user questions

🧩 Step 6: Test All Features
✅ Test image generation by typing prompts

✅ Upload voice message and verify transcription

✅ Upload PDF and ask questions

✅ Test sentiment analysis on text inputs

✅ Verify DynamoDB is storing conversation history

🧩 Step 7: Polish & Optimize
✅ Clean up Lambda logs with CloudWatch

✅ Add error handling for empty inputs, API errors

✅ Test load (Lambda is scalable!)

✅ Add professional menu in Telegram bot

🧩 Step 8: Optional Enhancements
✅ Add CloudFront to serve images faster

✅ Add monitoring with AWS CloudWatch

✅ Add auto-deployment using GitHub Actions

✅ Improve PDF handling with asynchronous Textract (for bigger files)

🏁 Conclusion
This project is a complete showcase of how you can use AWS serverless architecture and AI services to build an intelligent Telegram bot that can:

Generate images,

Understand speech,

Analyze sentiments,

Extract information from documents,

And store history for future analytics!

With no server maintenance and pay-per-use scalability, this is a production-grade design!
